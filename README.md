# Sales Data Analysis Using Nested Dictionaries

A **Python mini project** that analyzes monthly sales data stored in a JSON file to calculate total sales per person and identify top performers.   
This project demonstrates **file handling**, **nested dictionary** processing, data aggregation, and filtering using only core Python features.

## Features
- Reads structured sales data from a JSON file.   
- Processes nested dictionaries representing monthly sales.  
- Calculates total sales per person across all months. 
- Identifies individuals whose total sales exceed a defined threshold. 
- Uses clean, modular functions for reusability.
- Relies only on Python standard libraries. 

## Project Structure




---

## analyze_sales.py

---

## Requirements
- **Python 3.7 or higher**  
- **No external packages required**

---

## JSON Format

The script expects a JSON file containing monthly sales data structured as nested dictionaries.



If your file structure or field names differ, you may adjust the code accordingly.

## How to Use

1. Place your `sales.json` file in the project directory.  
2. Ensure the filename in `analyze_sales.py` matches your data file.  
3. Run the script:

## Purpose

This project is designed to demonstrate core Python data processing techniques, including reading structured data from JSON files, iterating through nested dictionaries, aggregating values, and filtering results using built-in data structures.  
It is suitable for beginners learning data analysis concepts as well as for showcasing clean, file-based data processing in Python.
